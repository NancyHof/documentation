# Experimental Design

### Overview


#### Phenotyping

The TERRA-REF project is collecting phenotype data from **%\[% N %\]% **sorghum genotypes grown in three locations:

* [**The Maricopa Agricultural Center**](/scientific-objectives-and-experimental-design/protocols/the-maricopa-agricultural-center-mac.md) \(MAC\) in Maricopa, Arizona
* **Kansas State University**, %\[% WHERE %\]%, Kanas
* **The Bellwether Foundation Phenotyping Facility** at the Donald [Danforth Plant Science Center](/scientific-objectives-and-experimental-design/protocols/bellweather-foundation-controlled-environment-phenotyping.md), St. Louis, Missouri.

At each location, a suite of phenotype data is collected by various systems and protocols.

### Genotyping

[Whole genome resequencing](experimental-design/experimental-design-genomics/) is being carried out on ~[400 sorghum accessions](experimental-design/experimental-design-genomics/sorghum-lines-genomics-year-1.md) to understand the landscape of genetic variation in the selected germplasm and enable high-resolution mapping of bioenergy traits with genome wide association studies \(GWAS\). Additionally, ~200 sorghum recombinant inbred lines \(RILs\) will be characterized with ~400,000 genetic markers using genotyping-by-sequencing \([Morris et al., 2013](http://www.g3journal.org/content/early/2013/09/13/g3.113.008417)\) for trait dissection in the RIL population and testcross hybrids of the RIL population.
