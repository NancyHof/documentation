# Maricopa Agricultural Center \(MAC\), Arizona

The Maricopa field site is located at the the [University of Arizona Maricopa Agricultural Center](http://cals-mac.arizona.edu/) and [USDA Arid Land Research Station in Maricopa](https://www.ars.usda.gov/pacific-west-area/maricopa-arizona/us-arid-land-agricultural-research-center/), Arizona.

## Phenotyping

%\[% Need more complete descriptions of each of these systems. What do they do? How often are they run? %\]%

* The [**Lemnatec Scanalyzer Field System**](http://www.lemnatec.com/products/hardware-solutions/scanalyzer-field/) is a field-scanning system that continuously images crops with a diverse array of [cameras and sensors](http://terraref.org/articles/lemnatec-scanalyzer-field-sensors/). It is the largest field crop analytics robot in the world, consisting of a 30-ton steel gantry that autonomously moves along two 200-meter steel rails while imaging crops. Twelve sensors are attached to the gantry system. Detailed information for each sensor including name, variable measured, and field of view are [available here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Nfabx_n1rNlO6NW3olD8MAibJ3KHnOMmMwOYYw4wwGc/pubhtml?gid=1886254108&single=true&widget=true&headers=false).
* The **PhenoTractor** is fitted with a sensor frame that supports a real time kinematic \(RTK\) satellite navigation antenna, a sonar transducer,  an infrared temperature \(IRT\) scanner, and three [GreenSeeker crop sensing systems](http://www.trimble.com/agriculture/greenseeker.aspx).
* **UAV** \(release V1\)
* **Manually Collected Field Data** - Data will are collected manually using standard field methods. These measurements are used to calibrate and validate phenotypes derived from sensor-collected data.

## Plantings

* Season 1 sorghum \(April - July 2016\) 
* Season 2 sorghum \(August - November 2016\) 
* Durum wheat \(January 2017 -

### Season 1 sorghum \(April - July 2016\)

[Three hundred thirty one sorghum lines were planted in Season 1](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QQaWc0UaQQKfEtnSO1G2za8tKU2huC0_VYMBqm5CKAo/edit#gid=796817704).

* [West the scanner system](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QQaWc0UaQQKfEtnSO1G2za8tKU2huC0_VYMBqm5CKAo/edit#gid=193038411)

##### Planting Design

###### **Under scanner system**

| **Experiment** | **Reps** | **Treatments** | **Experimental design** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BAP | 3 | 30 lines \(12 PS, 12 sweet, 6 grain\) | RCB with sorghum types nested in groups |
| Night illumination | 3 | 5 illumination levels x 2 PS lines \(with check line separating illumination levels\) | RCB |
| Row \# | 3 | 6 adjacent plot scenarios: 3 lines \(forage, sweet, PS\) x 2 sides \(east or west\) | RCB but not balanced with all treatments in all reps |
| Biomass | 3 | 5 sampling times x 3 lines \(forage, sweet, PS\) | RCB with sampling time as a repeated measure |
| Density | 3 | 3 densities \(5, 15, 30 cm\) x 3 lines \(forage, sweet, PS\) | RCB |
| RILs | 3 | 130 RILs plus 10 repeats of a single line/rep | Incomplete Block \(row-column alpha lattice design\) |
| Uniformity | 17 | 2 lines \(forage, PS\) | None - Same line planted in single range |

###### **West of scanner system**

| **Experiment** | **Reps** | **Treatments** | **Experimental design** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BAP | 1 | 30 lines \(12 PS, 12 sweet, 6 grain\) | None - single rep planted for observation |
| RILs | 3 | 60 RILs | Incomplete Block \(row-column alpha lattice design\) |
