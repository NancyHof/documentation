# Protocols
%[%
Could be helpful to have a statement on the purpose of the protocols: standardize among sites but provide means for collaboration/comparison/extension with other research

It would be good to add any philosophy or preferences regarding protocols (i.e., are people encouraged to submit them, how detailed do you want them, etc.)

Even if protocols may not be standardized in reality, this could be a useful place to define the ‘ideal’ and guide future contributions

The following protocols have been contributed by TERRA-REF team members:

* **Field Scanner** - Coming 2017
* **Genomics** - Coming 2017
* [**Manually Collected Field Data**](manual-field-data-protocols.md)
* [**Phenotractor**](phenotractor-protocols.md)
* [**UAV**](uav-protocols.md)

A template for documenting protocols [is available here](template-protocol.md).
