# Genomics Experimental Designs

Genomic data includes whole-genome resequencing data from the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology, Alabama for 384 samples for accessions from the sorghum Bioenergy Association Panel (BAP) and genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) data from Kansas State University for 768 samples from a population of sorghum recombinant inbred lines (RIL).

#### Whole-genome resequencing

**Experimental Design:**

* [384 BAP samples](user/sorghum-lines-genomics.md) were sequenced to an average depth of ~25x.
* Shotgun sequencing (127-bp paired-end) was done using an Illumina X10 instrument at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology.
* Variant calling was done using a [computational pipeline](genomic-data-product.md) at the Danforth Center.
* See the [Data Products](products/genomics-data.md) page to get access to raw and derived data products.

#### Genotyping-by-sequencing

**Experimental Design:**

* [768 RIL samples](user/genotyping-by-sequencing.md) were sequenced using a GBS approach.
