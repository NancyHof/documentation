# Using CyVerse

### About CyVerse

[CyVerse](http://www.cyverse.org/) is a National Science Foundation funded cyberinfrastructure that aims to democratize access to supercomputing capabilities. 

### Accessing Data via CyVerse

TERRA-REF genomics data is accessible on the CyVerse Data Store and Discovery Environment. Accessing data through the CyVerse Discovery Environment requires signing up for a free CyVerse account. The Discovery Environment gives users access to software and computing resources, so this method has the advantage that TERRA-REF data can be utilized directly without the need to copy the data elsewhere. During the TERRA-REF [beta release period](user/release_schedule.md), users will need to request access to the TERRA-REF CyVerse Community Data folder through the TERRA-REF [beta user application](http://terraref.org/data/). The TERRA-REF Community Data folder can be found at `/iplant/home/shared/terraref`.
